## CVedia Pong (C# Unity Project)

A project testing the Unity3D capabilities with basic networking. 
I decided to create the example with a only 1 asset for UI (NGUI) to test networking and C#.
The Pong game can be customized remotely, Before the game starts the game downloads assets that are hosted online.

## Built With

Unity Pro 5.35 and NGUI for the UI elements.
