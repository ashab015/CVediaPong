# CVedia Pong

A project demonstrating my current Unity 3D capabilities and programming abilities. 
I decided to create the example with a only 1 asset for UI (NGUI) to show I have a deep understanding of networking and C#.
The Pong game can be customized remotely, Before the game starts the game downloads assets that are hosted online.

## Built With

Unity Pro 5.35 and NGUI for the UI elements.
