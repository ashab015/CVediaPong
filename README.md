# CVedia Pong

A project demonstrating my current Unity 3D capabilities and programming abilities. 
I decided to create the example with a only 1 asset for UI (NGUI) to show my lack of need of others assets.
The Pong game can be customized remotely, Before the game starts the game downloads assets that are hosted online.

## Built With

Unity Pro 5.35 and NGUI for the UI elements.
